<h2>Why should you care?</h2>
<p>Almost everyone use the computer, iPad, phoneâ€¦ for working or simply because of fun,<p> 
<p>the only problem is that you are 24/7 in a server and by using it your are wasting energy<p> 
<p>and in some point you are going to change your device but also you have to print papers that at some point<p>
<p>you are never going to use another time and not only you are polluting but also you are throwing money that you could <p>use in more important things </p>

<h2>So what can we do to change this?</h2>
<p>+Turn off the devices you are not using those can waste much more energy when you are not using those than when you are<p> 
<p>+Recicle old equipment like seling the items that still working, you not only help the planet but also your economy<p> 
<p>+When shopping search for eco- friendly packages<p>
<p>+Transition from paper to digital procceses, digital items pollute les than the paper<p>  
<p>+Well taking about work instead of going to the actual work meeting (in other countries) you can web conference</p>
